Goal: Build a web app that lets users select foods, specify quantities in chosen units, and track nutritional intake (calories, protein, fats, sugar, salt).



Tech Stack:





Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS (for styling).



Database: JSON file or localStorage for simplicity (can be upgraded to a backend database later).



No backend: Focus on client-side functionality to keep it beginner-friendly.



Duration: 10 steps, each building a part of the app.



Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to use a text editor and browser developer tools.
